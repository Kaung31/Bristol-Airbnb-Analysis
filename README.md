ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQLite via DBeaver)

    Imported raw listings and reviews CSVs into SQLite.

    Applied quality rules: removed nulls, capped extreme outliers, standardised columns.

    Created clean tables and summary views for analysis.

2. Data Analysis in R

    Connected to the cleaned SQLite database.

    Generated aggregated datasets (prices by neighbourhood & room type, review trends, etc.).

    Exported tidy CSVs for Tableau visualisation.

3. Visualisation in Tableau

    Built an interactive dashboard with neighbourhood filters, price heatmaps, and review trends.

ðŸ“‚ Data Access

    The SQLite database (bristol_airbnb.db) is not included in this repo because it exceeds GitHubâ€™s 100 MB limit.

    Instead, you can work with the cleaned CSV exports in the /exports folder â€” these contain all data needed for visualisation in Tableau.
